                    The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin pronounced [ˈvʲɛd͡ʑmʲin]) is a
                    series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by
                    Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around
                    the
                    eponymous "witcher", Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works,
                    "witchers" are beast hunters who develop supernatural
                    abilities
                    at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The
                    Witcher
                    began with a titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered
                    into a competition held by Fantastyka magazine, marking his
                    debut as an author. Due to reader demand, Sapkowski wrote 14
                    more stories before starting a series of novels in 1994.
                    Known
                    as The Witcher Saga, he wrote one book a year until the
                    fifth
                    and final installment in 1999. A standalone prequel novel,
                    Season of Storms, was published in 2013.

                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph-2">
                    The books have been described as having a cult following in
                    Poland and Central and Eastern European countries. They have
                    been translated into 37 languages and sold over 15 million
                    copies worldwide as of December 2019. They have also been
                    adapted into a film (The Hexer), two television series (The
                    Hexer and The Witcher), several video games, and two comic
                    book
                    series. The video games have been even more successful, with
                    more than 50 million copies sold as of May 2020.

                    Witcher</h2>
                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph-3">
                    The stories are set on an unnamed Continent, which was
                    settled several thousand years earlier by elves from
                    overseas. When they arrived, the elves encountered gnomes
                    and dwarves. After a war between the elves and dwarves, the
                    dwarves retreated into the mountains, and the elves settled
                    in the plains and forests. Human colonists arrived about
                    five hundred years before the events in the stories,
                    igniting a series of wars. The humans were victorious and
                    became dominant; the non-human races, now considered
                    second-class citizens, often live in small ghettos within
                    human settlements. Those not confined to the ghettos live in
                    wilderness regions not yet claimed by humans. Other races on
                    the Continent are halflings and dryads; werewolves and
                    vampires appeared after a magical event known as the
                    Conjunction of the Spheres.
                </p>
                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph-4">During the centuries
                    preceding the stories, most of the
                    Continent's southern regions have been taken over by the
                    Nilfgaard Empire; the north belongs to the fragmented
                    Northern Kingdoms. The Witcher Saga takes place in the
                    aftermath of the first major war between the Nilfgaard
                    Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, with a second war
                    beginning in the middle of the series.
