                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph">
                    The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin pronounced [ˈvʲɛd͡ʑmʲin]) is a
                    series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by
                    Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around
                    the
                    eponymous "witcher", Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works,
                    "witchers" are beast hunters who develop supernatural
                    abilities
                    at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The
                    Witcher
                    began with a titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered
                    into a competition held by Fantastyka magazine, marking his
                    debut as an author. Due to reader demand, Sapkowski wrote 14
                    more stories before starting a series of novels in 1994.
                    Known
                    as The Witcher Saga, he wrote one book a year until the
                    fifth
                    and final installment in 1999. A standalone prequel novel,
                    Season of Storms, was published in 2013.

                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph-2">
                    The books have been described as having a cult following in
                    Poland and Central and Eastern European countries. They have
                    been translated into 37 languages and sold over 15 million
                    copies worldwide as of December 2019. They have also been
                    adapted into a film (The Hexer), two television series (The
                    Hexer and The Witcher), several video games, and two comic
                    book
                    series. The video games have been even more successful, with
                    more than 50 million copies sold as of May 2020.

                <h2 id="witcher-origins-title-2">Backstory Leading to the
                    Witcher</h2>
                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph-3">
                    The stories are set on an unnamed Continent, which was
                    settled several thousand years earlier by elves from
                    overseas. When they arrived, the elves encountered gnomes
                    and dwarves. After a war between the elves and dwarves, the
                    dwarves retreated into the mountains, and the elves settled
                    in the plains and forests. Human colonists arrived about
                    five hundred years before the events in the stories,
                    igniting a series of wars. The humans were victorious and
                    became dominant; the non-human races, now considered
                    second-class citizens, often live in small ghettos within
                    human settlements. Those not confined to the ghettos live in
                    wilderness regions not yet claimed by humans. Other races on
                    the Continent are halflings and dryads; werewolves and
                    vampires appeared after a magical event known as the
                    Conjunction of the Spheres.
                </p>
                <p id="witcher-origins-paragraph-4">During the centuries
                    preceding the stories, most of the
                    Continent's southern regions have been taken over by the
                    Nilfgaard Empire; the north belongs to the fragmented
                    Northern Kingdoms. The Witcher Saga takes place in the
                    aftermath of the first major war between the Nilfgaard
                    Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, with a second war
                    beginning in the middle of the series.

                <h2>Lord of The Rings</h2>
                <p id="lord-of-the-rings-paragraph">
                    The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by
                    English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in
                    Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937
                    children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a
                    much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949,
                    The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever
                    written, with over 150 million copies sold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark
                    Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to
                    rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and
                    Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From
                    homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of
                    the English countryside, the story ranges across
                    Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring,
                    seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam,
                    Merry and Pippin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although often called a trilogy, the work was intended by
                    Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along with The
                    Silmarillion. For economic reasons, The Lord of the
                    Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July
                    1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes titled The
                    Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of
                    the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two
                    per volume, with several appendices of background material.
                    Some later editions print the entire work in a single
                    volume, following the author's original intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the
                    literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive
                    analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this
                    earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings,
                    include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy
                    works, and his own experiences in the First World War.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest
                    fantasy books ever written and it has helped to create and
                    shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been
                    reprinted many times and translated into at least 38
                    languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous
                    references in popular culture, the founding of many
                    societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication
                    of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired
                    many derivative works, including paintings, music, films,
                    television, video games, and board games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been
                    made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's
                    best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's 2003 poll The Big
                    Read.
